# Tech Stack Api 
## Based on the udemy cours The Complete React Native + Hooks Course

In the Udemy course we create React Native App to show different tech stacks. We add the data hardcoded on a json file in the app.

This is the api to get the same data.


## Postman

GET localhost:3000/stacks

## Please Follow the instructions to import the data from this API
